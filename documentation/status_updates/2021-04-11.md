# Architecture
* **Frontend** SPA (single page application) based on Vue.js
  * Componentbased, fast, reusable
  * Contains service provider for interaction with backend
* **Backend** based on Spring
  * Provides interaction using REST API
  * Maybe initiates websocket messages (real time updates)
  * Serves SPA
* Any common SQL database (MySQL, MariaDB, ...)

# Milestones
* **Project Setup**
  * Focus on Frontend/Backend setup and concept improvement
* **Milestone 1**
  * Focus on timecube API, Authentification, first GUI / Websocket implementations
* **Milestone 2**
  * Focus on GUI, REST / WS implementation, UI Tests
* **Milestone 3**
  * Admin Menu, extended testing (concept and UI)
  * Improvement on documentation (if not yet done)
  * ... (if issues are moved)

# Current status
* Easter break wasn't that efficient (some members did way less, therefore, we had to move the milestone)
* Communication was bad
* Time struggles in the end

How to improve this?
* 2-3 days updates in slack
* 1-2 meetings per week
* Better monitoring

# Other dissatisfactions
* Some people commited to dev/main, which is not intended
* TimeCube communication
* No swagger (We created large tables as documentation)
* Bad WS support (Spring, Vue)

# Approved solutions (to fix timing / communication issues)
* Daily Updates - "Check in" System (See concept)
* SO 21:00 Feature Freeze for release
* Concretized architects
* Two jour fixe dates per week
* Every member has to select one issue until 12.04.2021
